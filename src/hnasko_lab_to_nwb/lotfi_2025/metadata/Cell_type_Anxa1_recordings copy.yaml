  experiment_description: Mice were freely moving on a plastic tub.
    Simultaneous passive optogenetic stimulation and fiber photometry recordings were conducted during the first two days.
    Excitatory inputs from either the STN or PPN to SN were stimulated.
    Recordings of GCaMP6f fluorescence signal captured pan-DA activity in the substantia nigra pars compacta in VGLUT2-Cre x DAT-Flp mice.

  surgery:
    Mice > 6 weeks old were anesthetized with isofluorane (4% for induction and 1-2% for maintenance), and provided with pre- and post-surgical analgesic carprofen (5 mg/kg i.p).
    For calcium recordings in Vglut2-phiC X Anxa1-cre mice were injected with 300 nl of AAV1-Ef1a-fDIO-GCaMP6f (4e12 vg/mL, Addgene 1283125) in SNc (AP -3.2, ML +/-1.3, DV 4.3) and DLS (AP +0.5, ML +/-2.25, DV -2.95).
    For optogenetic stimulation, 150-200 nl of AAV5-Syn-FLEX-ChrimsonR-tdTomato (4 - 8.5e12 vg/ml, Addgene 62723) was injected in either STN (AP -2.00, ML +/-1.6, DV -4.5) or PPN (AP -4.48, ML +/- 1.1, DV -3.75).
    A fiber was implanted in SNc (200-um core, 0.39 NA, L = 6 mm, 1.25-mm diameter white ceramic ferrule, RWD) and, for a subset of subjects,
    a second fiber (400-um core, 0.39 NA, L = 4 mm, 1.25-mm black ceramic ferrule, RWD) was implanted in DLS (AP +0.5, ML +/- 2.25, DV -2.75).

Subject:
  species: Mus musculus
  description:
    All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
    Male and female mice were bred at UCSD and group-housed on a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with food and water ad libitum.
    VGLUT2-Cre (Slc17a6tm2(cre)Lowl, RRID:IMSR_JAX:016963) and VGAT-Flp (Slc32a1tm1.1(flpo)Hze, RRID:IMSR_JAX:029591) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and maintained backcrossed on to C57BL/6J (RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664).
    The DAT-Flp (Slc6a3em1(flpo)Hbat, RRID:IMSR_JAX:035436) were generously provided by Dr. Helen Bateup (UC Berkeley).
    VGLUT2-PhiC31 (Jeong et al. 2024) mice were generously provided by Dr. Lim (UC San Diego).
    DAT-Flp (Slc6a3em1(flpo)NW Jax and RRID) and Anxa1-Cre (RRID:MMRRC_069931-MU) were generously provided by Dr.Awatramani (Northwestern).
