  experiment_description: Mice were freely moving on a plastic tub.
    Simultaneous passive optogenetic stimulation and fiber photometry recordings were conducted during the first two days.
    Excitatory inputs from either the STN or PPN to SN were stimulated.
    Recordings of GCaMP8f fluorescence signal captured Anxa1+ neurons and terminals projecting to DLS in VGLUT2-PhiC x Anxa1-Cre mice.

  surgery:
    Mice > 6 weeks old were anesthetized with isofluorane (4% for induction and 1-2% for maintenance), and provided with pre- and post-surgical analgesic carprofen (5 mg/kg i.p).
    For recording from Anxa1+ neurons and terminals projecting to DLS, VGLUT2-PhiC x Anxa1-Cre mice were injected with 150-200 nl of AAVDJ-Ef1a-pSIO-ChrimsonR-tdTomato (1e13 vg/ml, Vectorbuilder) in STN or PPN at the same coordinates as above.
    And injected with 300 nl of AAV5-Syn-FLEX-GCaMP8f (1e13 vg/ml, Addgene 162379) in SNc (AP -3.20, ML +/-1.30, DV -4.30).
    Optic fibers were implanted in both SNc and DLS (400-um core, 0.39 NA, L = 6 or 4 mm, 1.25-mm black ceramic ferrule, RWD).

  species: Mus musculus
  description:
    All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
    Male and female mice were bred at UCSD and group-housed on a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with food and water ad libitum.
    VGLUT2-Cre (Slc17a6tm2(cre)Lowl, RRID:IMSR_JAX:016963) and VGAT-Flp (Slc32a1tm1.1(flpo)Hze, RRID:IMSR_JAX:029591) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and maintained backcrossed on to C57BL/6J (RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664).
    The DAT-Flp (Slc6a3em1(flpo)Hbat, RRID:IMSR_JAX:035436) were generously provided by Dr. Helen Bateup (UC Berkeley).
    VGLUT2-PhiC31 (Jeong et al. 2024) mice were generously provided by Dr. Lim (UC San Diego).
    DAT-Flp (Slc6a3em1(flpo)NW Jax and RRID) and Anxa1-Cre (RRID:MMRRC_069931-MU) were generously provided by Dr.Awatramani (Northwestern).
