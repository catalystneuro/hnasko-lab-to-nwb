  experiment_description: Mice were freely moving on a plastic tub.
    Simultaneous passive optogenetic stimulation and fiber photometry recordings were conducted during the first two days.
    Excitatory inputs from either the STN or PPN to SN were stimulated and the DA release in striatal subregions (DLS or TS) in VGLUT2-Cre mice were recorded.

    - Hollon, Nick
  surgery:
    Mice > 6 weeks old were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% for induction; 1-2% for maintenance).
    For monitoring DA release in striatal subregions VGLUT2-Cre mice were injected with AAV5-Syn-FLEX-ChrimsonR-tdTomato in either STN or PPN as above.
    And 300 nl of AAV9-EF1a-GRABDA2m (2e12 vg/mL, Addgene 140553) was injected in either DLS (AP +0.5, ML +/-2.25, DV -2.95) or TS (AP -1.25, ML +/-2.9, DV -3.45).
    A fiber was implanted in SNc (200-um core, 0.39 NA, L = 6 mm, 1.25-mm diameter white ceramic ferrule, RWD) and
    a second fiber (400-um core, 0.39 NA, L = 4 mm, 1.25-mm black ceramic ferrule, RWD) was implanted in DLS (AP +0.5, ML +/- 2.25, DV -2.75)
    or TS (AP -1.25, ML +/2.9, DV -3.25).
    Mice were allowed to recover for 4 weeks before starting experiments.

  description:
    All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
    Male and female mice were bred at UCSD and group-housed on a 12-hour light/dark cycle, with food and water ad libitum.
    VGLUT2-Cre (Slc17a6tm2(cre)Lowl, RRID:IMSR_JAX:016963) and VGAT-Flp (Slc32a1tm1.1(flpo)Hze, RRID:IMSR_JAX:029591) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and maintained backcrossed on to C57BL/6J (RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664).
    The DAT-Flp (Slc6a3em1(flpo)Hbat, RRID:IMSR_JAX:035436) were generously provided by Dr. Helen Bateup (UC Berkeley).
    VGLUT2-PhiC31 (Jeong et al. 2024) mice were generously provided by Dr. Lim (UC San Diego).
    DAT-Flp (Slc6a3em1(flpo)NW Jax and RRID) and Anxa1-Cre (RRID:MMRRC_069931-MU) were generously provided by Dr.Awatramani (Northwestern).
