  experiment_description: Mice were freely moving on a plastic tub.
    Simultaneous passive optogenetic stimulation and fiber photometry recordings were conducted during the first two days.
    Excitatory inputs from either the STN or PPN to SN were stimulated and the activity of SN GABAergic neurons were recorded.
    Then mice underwent uncued electrical shocks and were recorded using fiber photometry.

    Mice > 6 weeks old were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% for induction; 1-2% for maintenance).
    For fiber photometry experiments, mice were unilaterally injected with 300nl of AAV1-fDIO-Ef1a-Gcamp6f
    (4e12 vg/mL, Addgene 1283125) in SNr (AP -3.3, ML 1.3, DV -4.60) and 150nl or 200nl AAV5-DIO-Syn-ChrimsonR-Tdtomato
    (4e12 vg/mL or 8.5e12 vg/mL, Addgene 62723) in either STN (AP -2.00, ML 1.6, DV -4.50) or PPN (AP -4.48, ML 1.1, DV -3.75).
    A single photometry fiber (RWD, 400um, 0.39 NA) was implanted in SNr (AP -3.3, ML 1.4, DV -4.40),
    which served for optogenetic stimulation and photometry recordings.
    Mice were allowed to recover for 4 weeks before starting experiments.

  description:
    Male and female were bred at University of California San Diego (UCSD) and group-housed on a 12-hour light/dark cycle,
    with food and water ad libitum. VGLUT2-IRES-CRE and VGAT-2A-FlpO-D knock-in mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory
    Slc17a6tm2(cre)Lowl (RRID:IMSR_JAX:016963) Slc32a1tm1.1(flpo)Hze (RRID:IMSR_JAX:029591) and maintained backcrossed on to C57BL/6J.
    VGlut2-Cre animals were crossed with VGAT-flp animals to generate dual transgenic animals that were VGlut2-Cre/VGAT-flp and used for experiments.
    All experiments were performed on animals of at least 6 weeks of age and in accordance with protocols approved by UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

      description: The metadata of the fiber photometry setup.
        The recordings were done using a fiber photometry rig with optical components from Tucker David Technologies (TDT)
        and Doric lenses controlled by a real-time processor from TDT (RZ10x).
        TDT software Synapse was used for data acquisition.
        Gcamp6f was excited by amplitude modulated signals from two light-emitting diodes (465- and 405-nm isosbestic control, TDT).
        Stimulation and shock timestamps were digitized in Synapse software by respectively AnyMaze and MedPC.
